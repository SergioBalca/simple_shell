.SH NAME
Simple Shell

.SH SYNOPSIS
Simple Linux Shell program. This project is about coding a simple shell with simple usages in C.
the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and passes them to the machine to execute them through the kernel to perform. We can interact with this program through the terminal.

The library "main.h" is needed to use this function, use: #include "main.h"

.SH DESCRIPTION
Its a command line interpreter that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes commands.It has direct access to the Kernel.

.SH USAGE
All the files are to be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
You must download all the files contained in the project repository in order for this program to work.
This program must be compiled with gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -g *.c -o

.SH EXECUTION
This Shell has 2 modes of execution: interactive and non-interactive.

This depends on what the user sents to the program.

The interactive mode allows us to input and execute commands for an infinite amount of times as long as the shell is running and its not "exit" or "EOF"(Ctrl + d).


.SH RETURN VALUES
If successful it will return 0 and execute the command. If it doesnt find a command, will return an error, and print a message with: 'No such file or directory'.

.SH FORMAT COMMANDS

This shell have been tested with the following commands that are proved to work:
/bin/ls, ls, pwd, ls -la, env, exit, (ctrl + d).
